I didn't realise how big of an introvert I am until I joined my marketing course

*When the fear of presenting in front of 60 others like me kept me up the entire night
*When I had to come up with campaign ideas on the go
*When I had to undertake case  studies analyse and debate on the same
*When i had to ve part of the events

It gave me anxiety but I kept on moving and though I have grown and it's gotten easier it still feels like fighting dragons left and right.
