I too a two month vacation from all digital platforms. It ws a huge risk especially as a digital marketer. But is it ws the best decision ever. I ws so overwhelmed keeping up with all the social media trends nd was feeling burnt out.

## The things I did during the two months
*spent some quality time with friends and family back home
*Binge watched all the latest netflix series
*Ate all my favourite food
*Went to the beach
*Made a huge ton of memories

## The things that I learned in the last two months
*Nothing beats the energy you feel when you are with your people
*There is so much that we miss out when we are so entranced by our fones
*You need to take care of your body and mind
*Spending time with the people you love and doing things that you enjoy the most is the best
